  <h2>Interactive Google Map</h2>

   The changes I made to this map were to zoom it out more so that all 5 of my points are visible
    when the map first opens. Previously, some of the points were not viewable during submission.

  
  <h2>ArcGIS StoryMap</h2>

 I included the sources I used, which were missing in my original submission. I also revised the
    guided map tour with more specific information related to the examples I presented.

  I have not yet received feedback on this assignment, but Iâ€™m looking forward to refining it once I do.
