  <h1>UMass Amherst Mapping & Tools</h1>

  <h2>Interactive Google Map</h2>
  <h3>This map showcases 5 points I chose at random at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Campus</h3>

   The changes I made to this map were to zoom it out more so that all 5 of my points are visible
    when the map first opens. Previously, some of the points were not viewable during submission.

  
  <h2>ArcGIS StoryMap</h2>
  <h3>This story map provides real-life examples of  some classifications of wetlands and deepwater habitats using the Cowardin Classification and Web Soil Survey. </h3>

 I included the sources I used, which were missing in my original submission. I also revised the
    guided map tour with more specific information related to the examples I presented below
  
  <h2>Local Restaurant Form</h2>
  <h3> I created this survey as a way for people to learn about local restaurants in their area, and to find parking for these places. In my experience, sometimes finding parking is challenging for these local resturaunts.</h3>

  I have not yet received feedback on this assignment, but Iâ€™m looking forward to refining it once I do.
